        #### Project Guidance

        - Please be patient: this is a large open source project overseen by a mix of volunteers and non-volunteers, and everyone is ultimately busy.
        - If your suggestion is a troubleshooting scenario or something you're not 100% certain about, please post for feedback on the [Nextcloud Help Forum](https://help.nextcloud.com) first.
          - Afterwards, return here to share your experience and help improve the documentation for clarity, etc. (and link back to the forum discussion in your report!)

        #### Pro Tip: Want to help even more?

        - Look for areas where you can assist - even seemingly unrelated areas - as doing so frees up resources for your favorite topics and ideas.
        - Submit a proposed change that addresses your issue as a pull request.
        - Participate in discussions on other unresolved [submitted ideas ("issues")](https://github.com/nextcloud/documentation/issues) to help move them forward.
        - Post a comment or review on someone else's [proposed change ("pull request")](https://github.com/nextcloud/documentation/pulls) to help move it along.
