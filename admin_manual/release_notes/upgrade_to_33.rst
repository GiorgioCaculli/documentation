=======================
Upgrade to Nextcloud 33
=======================

System configuration
--------------------

If you configured restrictions on which domains can be contacted on the internet, you need to add connectivity.nextcloud.com to the allowlist, as itâ€™s now used by default to test internet connectivity instead of www.nextcloud.com. You can also configure any other URL to use in the configuration instead. See :ref:`connections_to_remote_servers`.
